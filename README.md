This is the repository for the milestone 5 assignment. 
This Github repository contains the pdf file of the Wikipedia article 'Rijksuniversiteit Groningen',
called 'Rijksuniversiteit_Groningen.pdf', 
and a shell script called 'de_counter.sh', which works on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS. 
The article can be accessed here: https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksuniversiteit_Groningen.
The article can be downloaded under the 'afdrukken/exporteren' box. 
The article was last modified on 10 January 2020 at 11:52.
The shell script extracts the text from the Wikipedia article in format
converts it into a text file,
and counts how many times the word 'de' occurs in the text file.
It outputs the amount of occurences of 'de' in the article,
and displays this within an English sentence. 

The final output is as follows:

Total amount of left-wing articles about Trump with an overall positive sentiment: 234
Total amount of right-wing articles about Trump with an overall positive sentiment: 208

Total amount of left-wing articles about Trump with an overall negative sentiment: 358
Total amount of right-wing articles about Trump with an overall negative sentiment: 369

Depending on your version of Linux, the terminal will show the processes of extracting the zip files.
