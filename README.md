This is the repository for the milestone 5 assignment. 
This Github repository contains the pdf file of the Wikipedia article 'Rijksuniversiteit Groningen',
called 'Rijksuniversiteit_Groningen.pdf', 
and a shell script called 'de_counter.sh', which works on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS. 
The article can be accessed here: https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksuniversiteit_Groningen.
The article can be downloaded under the 'afdrukken/exporteren' box. 
The article was last modified on 10 January 2020 at 11:52.
The shell script extracts the text from the Wikipedia article in format
converts it into a text file,
and counts how many times the word 'de' occurs in the text file.
It outputs the amount of occurences of 'de' in the article,
and displays this within an English sentence. 

The output is as follows:

The word 'de' occurs 238 times in the Wikipedia article.
